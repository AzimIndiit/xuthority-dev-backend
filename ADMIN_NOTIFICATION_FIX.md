# Admin Notification Fix for OAuth Registrations

## Issue Description
When users registered via OAuth (Google or LinkedIn), admin notifications were not being created. This affected both user and vendor registrations through social login.

## Root Cause
The passport strategies in `src/config/passport.js` were creating new users but not calling the admin notification service (`notifyAdminsNewUser`) or user notification service (`createNotification`).

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Passport Strategies (`src/config/passport.js`)

**Added imports:**
```javascript
const { createNotification } = require('../services/notificationService');
const { notifyAdminsNewUser } = require('../services/adminNotificationService');
```

**Google OAuth Strategy:**
- Added welcome notification for new users
- Added admin notification for new user/vendor registrations
- Added proper error handling for notification failures

**LinkedIn OAuth Strategy:**
- Added welcome notification for new users
- Added admin notification for new user/vendor registrations
- Added proper error handling for notification failures

### 2. Fixed Admin Notification Service (`src/services/adminNotificationService.js`)

**Fixed `notifyAdminsNewUser` function:**
- Changed from using `user.name` to proper `firstName` and `lastName` fields
- Added proper display name construction
- Updated message formatting

**Fixed `notifyAdminsBadgeRequest` function:**
- Changed from using `user.name` to proper `firstName` and `lastName` fields
- Added proper display name construction

**Fixed `notifyAdminsPaymentSuccess` function:**
- Changed from using `user.name` to proper `firstName` and `lastName` fields
- Added proper display name construction

## Notification Flow

### For New User Registration (OAuth):
1. User completes OAuth authentication
2. Passport strategy creates new user
3. **Welcome notification** sent to user
4. **Admin notification** sent to all admins
5. User receives access token and is redirected

### For New Vendor Registration (OAuth):
1. Vendor completes OAuth authentication
2. Passport strategy creates new vendor user
3. **Welcome notification** sent to vendor
4. **Admin notification** sent to all admins (with vendor-specific message)
5. Vendor receives access token and is redirected

## Notification Types

### User Notifications:
- **Type:** `WELCOME`
- **Title:** "Welcome to XUTHORITY!"
- **Message:** Role-specific welcome message
- **Action URL:** `/` for users, `/dashboard` for vendors

### Admin Notifications:
- **Type:** `USER_REGISTRATION` or `VENDOR_REGISTRATION`
- **Title:** "New User Joined" or "New Vendor Application"
- **Message:** Role-specific admin message
- **Action URL:** `/users/{userId}`

## Testing

The fix has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Admin notifications are created for new OAuth registrations
- ✅ User welcome notifications are created for new OAuth registrations
- ✅ Proper error handling prevents registration failures if notifications fail
- ✅ Display names are correctly constructed from firstName and lastName
- ✅ Both Google and LinkedIn OAuth strategies are updated

## Files Modified

1. `src/config/passport.js` - Added notification calls to OAuth strategies
2. `src/services/adminNotificationService.js` - Fixed user name handling

## Impact

- **Before:** OAuth registrations created no admin notifications
- **After:** OAuth registrations create both user and admin notifications
- **Coverage:** All OAuth providers (Google, LinkedIn) for both user and vendor roles

## Error Handling

Notifications are wrapped in try-catch blocks to ensure that:
- Registration success is not affected by notification failures
- Errors are logged for debugging
- User experience remains smooth even if notifications fail

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing functionality remains unchanged
- Email registrations continue to work as before
- No breaking changes to existing APIs
